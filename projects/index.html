<ul>
  <li class="projects-list">Wordify: A Reverse Dictionary for Everyone<a href="https://github.com/jshcs/wordify" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/github.png" /></a>
  <ul>
    <li class="projects-description-list">Developed a reverse dictionary which can summarize any phrase to a single word.</li>
    <li class="projects-description-list">Trained a LSTM network using pretrained GloVe embeddings as the starting point on the WordNet dataset.</li>
    <li class="projects-description-list">The LSTM based method outperformed the baseline methods which were based on the arithmetic properties of the
word embeddings.</li>
    <li class="projects-description-list">Keras w/ TensorFlow backend was used to design the model.</li>
  </ul>
  </li><br><br>
  <li class="projects-list">Motley: Color the Uncolored<a href="https://github.com/jshcs/motley" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/github.png" /></a>
  <ul>
    <li class="projects-description-list">Developed a system based on CNN that can color a grayscale image given as an input.</li>
    <li class="projects-description-list">Developed a baseline method to compare the performance of the CNN.</li>
    <li class="projects-description-list">The model was trained on resized images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.</li>
    <li class="projects-description-list">Keras w/ TensorFlow backend was used to design the model.</li>
    <li class="projects-description-list">Under active development.</li>

  <li class="projects-list">Sudoku Solver<a href="https://github.com/jshcs/ai_sudoku" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/github.png" /></a> <a href="/ai_sudoku"><span>Try it out!</span></a>
  <ul>
    <li class="projects-description-list">Developed an AI agent that can solve any Sudoku puzzle provided as an input.</li>
    <li class="projects-description-list">Constraint Propagation was used to efficiently reduce the domain of the variables.</li>
    <li class="projects-description-list">Minimum Remaining Values heuristic was used to select the most optimal variable for assignment.</li>
  </ul>
  </li><br><br>
  <li class="projects-list">Grasp: A Visual Question Answering Machine<a href="https://github.com/jshcs/graspQA" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/github.png" /></a>
  <ul>
    <li class="projects-description-list">Developed a system that can answer questions based on an image using CNN and GRU.</li>
    <li class="projects-description-list">The models were trained on the Visual7W dataset.</li>
    <li class="projects-description-list">Under active development.</li>
  </ul>

  <li class="projects-list">Monte Carlo Image De-noising<a href="https://github.com/jshcs/dnoise" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/github.png" /></a>
  <ul>
    <li class="projects-description-list">Applied Monte Carlo Inference to de-noise any noisy image given as an input.</li>
    <li class="projects-description-list">Gibbs Sampling was used to obtain observations from a Conditional Random Field(CRF) model of the image.</li>
  </ul>
  </li><br><br>
  <li class="projects-list">Autonomous Navigation and Control of an Omni-Directional Vehicle
  <ul>
    <li class="projects-description-list">Implemented path-planning algorithms on a four-wheeled omni drive vehicle using sensor fusion technique.</li>
    <li class="projects-description-list">STM-32 was used to drive the motors and Raspberry Pi was used as a CPU.</li>
  </ul>
